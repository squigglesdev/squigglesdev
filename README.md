# Hey! I'm Squiggles. 

I'm 17, a full-time college student, and an aspiring game dev. I’m from the UK, and working hard to get myself into the gamedev industry. Being a student, this isn’t easy, but I’m doing by best to try and contribute to as many open-source projects as I can, and teach myself to make games.
