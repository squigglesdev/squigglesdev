# Hey! I'm Squiggles. 

I'm 15 and a senior school (high school for you Americans) student, who's dream job is to be a game dev. I've always loved games since I was a kid, and I've always wanted to know how they were made. I've been programming for about 5 years, but only in the last year has my skill really come along. I'm also not that bad at pixel art, so I'm in a pretty good situation. I haven't released any games yet due to the sheer lack of time I have, but I'm looking to apply for work experience at a local game dev studio once my GCSEs (exams) are done and dusted. Hopefully you can expect many games from me in the future!
